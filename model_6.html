                <h2>Logistic Regression algorithm</h2>
                <p>Logistic regression is a popular and widely used statistical model for binary classification tasks.
                    It is a linear model that estimates the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class
                    by applying a logistic function to a linear combination of the input features. The logistic
                    function, also known as the sigmoid function, transforms the linear output into a range of
                    probabilities between 0 and 1. During training, logistic regression adjusts the model parameters to
                    maximize the likelihood of the observed data. This optimization process is typically achieved using
                    techniques such as maximum likelihood estimation or gradient descent. Logistic regression is
                    interpretable, allowing for a clear understanding of the impact of each feature on the predicted
                    outcome. It can handle both numerical and categorical features, and its simplicity makes it
                    computationally efficient and well-suited for datasets with a large number of instances or features.
                    While logistic regression is primarily designed for binary classification, it can be extended to
                    handle multiclass problems through techniques like one-vs-rest or softmax regression. Overall,
                    logistic regression is a reliable and widely adopted algorithm for binary classification tasks,
                    offering simplicity, interpretability, and good performance in many scenarios.</p>

                <h2>Our Implementation</h2>
                <p> Initially, a parameter grid is defined, containing different hyperparameters and their respective
                    values, such as the penalty type, regularization strength (C), solver method, and maximum number of
                    iterations.
                    A Logistic Regression Classifier ('lr_clf') is then initialized with a specified random state.
                    Subsequently, GridSearchCV is employed to perform a comprehensive search over the parameter grid.
                    The GridSearchCV object ('grid_search_lr') is configured with 5-fold cross-validation and uses the
                    F1
                    score as the evaluation metric, which is suitable for imbalanced datasets. By fitting the
                    GridSearchCV object to the training data ('X_train_ds' and 'y_train_ds'), the optimal combination of
                    hyperparameters is determined, and the best parameters ('best_params_lr') are obtained.</p>
                <p> Using the identified best parameters, a new Logistic Regression model ('lr_clf_best') is created and
                    trained on the balanced training dataset. The resulting model is then employed to predict fraud
                    occurrences on the test set ('X_test'), and the predictions are stored in 'y_pred_up'. Additionally,
                    a
                    classification report is generated, providing a comprehensive overview of the model's performance on
                    the balanced data, including metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score.</p>

                <p> The hyperparameter tuning process ensures that the model is fine-tuned to achieve better
                    accuracy and reliability in detecting fraudulent activities, as indicated by the classification
                    report.</p>
