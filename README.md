# Project Title
Vehicle Insurance Fraud Claim Detection

# Description
This project aims to predict fraudulent insurance claims based on various features related to the claim and the claimant. The project uses several machine learning models including Random Forest, LightGBM, Gradient Boosting, MLP, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Decision Tree, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and AdaBoost. Each model is trained, hyperparameter-tuned, and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

The project involves the following steps:

- Data Loading
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Preprocessing
- Balancing the Dataset
- Model Training and Evaluation

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of insurance claim records with 25 features. Each record includes details about the claim and the claimant such as the driver's age, gender, marital status, safety rating, annual income, education level, and many more. The target variable is a binary feature indicating whether the claim was fraudulent or not.
